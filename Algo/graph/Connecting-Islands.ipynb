    "In an ocean, there are `n` islands some of which are connected via bridges. Travelling over a bridge has some cost attaced with it. Find bridges in such a way that all islands are connected with minimum cost of travelling. \n",

    "In addition to using a graph, you may want to use a custom priority queue for solving this problem.\n",

    "2. `heappop(heap)` — remove the smallest item from the `heap`\n",
